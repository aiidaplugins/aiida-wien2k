# aiida-wien2k
[WIEN2k](http://susi.theochem.tuwien.ac.at) plug-in for [AiiDA](https://www.aiida.net) workflow management in conjunction with the [Common workflow project](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-common-workflows). Eventually, it will be used to calculate the equation of state (Etot vs volume) for any structure by running a very basic SCF (i.g., without relaxation of atomic positions, magnetism, SOC, etc.) It is a work in progress and **not** ready to use yet. It is expected that the first version will be ready around spring 2022.
