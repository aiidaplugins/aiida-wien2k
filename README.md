# aiida-wien2k
[WIEN2k](http://susi.theochem.tuwien.ac.at) plug-in for [AiiDA](https://www.aiida.net) workflow management in conjunction with the [Common workflow project](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-common-workflows). Eventually, it will be used to calculate an equation of state (Etot vs volume) for any structure in AiiDA format by running a very basic SCF (i.g., a uniform scaling of all lattice parameters, no relaxation of atomic positions, no magnetism, no SOC, etc.) It is meant for DFT users who have no idea about WIEN2k, but still want to run EOS for benchmarking purposes using various DFT codes, including WIEN2k. It is a work in progress and **not** ready to use yet. It is expected that the first version will be ready around spring 2022.
